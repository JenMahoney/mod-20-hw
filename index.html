            <p class="card-text">
                Many car owners neglect their automobiles care because of the headache
                that comes with overwhelming amounts of resources without much community
                knowledge.

                Create an app for car enthusiasts to connect with others who share their
                interests and share their knowledge.

                look like.)

            <h5 class="card-subhead">Revised solution</h5>
            <p class="card-text">
                Create an app for the average car user that helps them track maintenance
                and find good deals on service in their area. This could be useful to an
                car owner whether they do their own maintenance or take it to a
                mechanic.

                    them.</li>

                WheelWise to track when he gets maintenance done on his car and gets notified when he has has auto work
                due. That way he stays on top of his auto care and keeps his car in excellent condition.

                We are designing WheelWise to help everyday car owners to have access to car knowledge, so they can
                either take care of maintenance themselves or know how much a good price would be. We have observed that
                many car owners don’t have proper community or guidance with auto maintenance, causing them to neglect
                taking care of their cars. This could be both hazardous and expensive to the car owner, and could happen
                anytime on the road. How might we build an app so that car owners are proactive with their auto
                maintenance?

                an "I like, I wish, What if" exercise. After dot voting on our favorites, I grouped them into four
                categories and we conducted another round of dot voting to identify our top three priorities.

            <p class="card-text">This last round of dot voting was the final decision to move away from the forum and
                community aspect and focus on the maintenance and cost savings potential in our app.

From the home screen the user gets to choose if the user wants to make a decision in finding local discount or adding a vehicle to the app. If the user decides to find local discounts, it will then ask a notification to allow GPS to find nearby shops. Either answer chosen (YES or No) takes the user back to the home page. From the home page, the user will now add a vehicle, the user will input car info (car name, model, make, etc). App will ask the user to make sure all info is correct before proceeding forward. Once info is confirmed, the user will now input car maintenance info (mileage, oil change, spark plug, etc.) now the user can hit add and allow for notifications if wanted to know maintenance done for the vehicle.

        <p class="card-text">
            With this project we were developed a streamlined approach for every day car users to stay on top of their auto work and maintenance. We developed an easy notification-based process that has a simple and easy to understand interface. </p>
            <p class="card-text">
            In the future we would like to implement more of a community aspect within the application to connect car owners with one another for topics like DIY maintenance and a hub for camaraderie and knowledge sharing. We would also like to finish implementing the miles tracker and have a rating system for local shops based on certain criteria in the area. </p>
            <p class="card-text">
            (If I were to continue this project I would also take into account the feedback we got from our presentation. In initial group discussions we brought up the possibility of connecting the app to a diagnostic tool as well as CarFax which would both be great additions to the functionality of the app, and were both brought up by classmates. I thought the comment about the sports car image on the prototype being off putting to those who own older cars to be a really good point. I would remove that image and replace it with more of an abstract car image.)</p>
